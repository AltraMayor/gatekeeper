 * Since the length of IPv6 policy is much larger than IPv4 policy,

 * to store the in-packet policies for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.
 *
 * Packet format: Ethernet headers + IP header + UDP header + Data.
 * In the UDP payload, the following format would save a lot of bytes
 * when there are decline decisions:
 *  v1, n1, n2, n3, n4: Each of these fields are 1-byte long.
 *  v1 is a constant indicating the version of the format, in this case 1.
 *  n1 is the number of IPv4 decline decisions.
 *  n2 is the number of IPv6 decline decisions.
 *  n3 is the number of IPv4 granted decisions.
 *  n4 is the number of IPv6 granted decisions.
 * 
 * Field v1 will enable us to change the format, incrementally update
 * the Gatekeeper servers, and incrementally update the Grantor servers.
 *
 * Notice that, to guarantee that all the accesses after struct ggu_common_hdr
 * in a packet are 32-bit aligned, we add uint8_t reserved[3]; at the very end
 * of struct ggu_common_hdr.

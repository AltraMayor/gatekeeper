 * is to put the two invocations of READ_ONCE in different C statements.
 *
 * READ_ONCE will also work on aggregate data types like structs or unions.
 * If the size of the accessed data type exceeds the word size of the machine
 * (e.g., 32 bits or 64 bits) READ_ONCE() will fall back to memcpy and print a
 * compile-time warning.
 *
 * Its two major use cases are: (1) Mediating communication between
 * process-level code and irq/NMI handlers, all running on the same CPU,
 * and (2) Ensuring that the compiler does not fold, spindle, or otherwise
 * mutilate accesses that either do not require ordering or that interact
 * with an explicit memory barrier or atomic instruction that provides the
 * required ordering.
